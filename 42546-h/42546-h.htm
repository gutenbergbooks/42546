<h2>LORD ORMONT'S MATE AND MATEY'S AMINTA.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap"><b>By</b></span>&emsp;G***GE M*R*D*TH.</h3>
<h3><span class="smcap">Volume III.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">And now the climax comes not with tongue-lolling sheep-fleece
wolves, ears on top remorselessly pricked for slaughter
of the bleating imitated lamb, here a fang pointing to nethermost
pit not of stomach but of Acheron, tail waving in derision
of wool-bearers whom the double-rowed desiring mouth
soon shall grip, food for mamma-wolf and baby-wolf, papa-wolf
looking on, licking chaps expectant of what shall remain;
and up goes the clamour of flocks over the country-side, and
up goes howling of shepherds shamefully tricked by Ã†sop-fable
artifice or doggish dereliction of primary duty; for a
watch has been set through which the wolf-enemy broke
paws on the prowl; and the King feels this, and the Government,
a slab-faced jubber-mubber of contending punies,
party-voters to the front, conscience lagging how far behind
no man can tell, and the country forgotten, a lout dragging
his chaw-bacon hobnails like a flask-fed snail housed safely,
he thinks, in unbreakable shell soon to be broken, and no
man's fault, while the slow country sinks to the enemy, ships
bursting, guns jammed, and a dull shadow of defeat on a
war-office drifting to the tide-way of unimagined back-stops
on a lumpy cricket-field of national interests. But this was a
climax revealed to the world. The Earl was deaf to it. Lady
<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> dumbed it surprisingly.
Change the spelling, put
a for u and n for b in the dumbed, and you have the way
<span class="smcap">Morsfield</span> mouthed it, and
 <span class="smcap">Matey</span> swimming with <span class="smcap">Browny</span>
full in the Harwich tide; head under heels up down they go
in Old Ocean, a glutton of such embraces, lapping softly on a
pair of white ducks tar-stained that very morning and no
mistake.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have you fast!" cried <span class="smcap">Matey</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">"Two and two's four," said <span class="smcap">Browny</span>.
She slipped. "<i>Are</i>
four," corrected he, a tutor at all times, boys and girls taken
in and done for, and no change given at the turnstiles.</p>

<p class="indent">"Catch as catch can," was her next word. Plop went a
wave full in the rosy mouth. "Where's the catch of this?"
stuttered the man.</p>

<p class="indent">"A pun, a pun!" bellowed the lady. "But not by four-in-hand
from London."</p>

<p class="indent">She had him there. He smiled a blue acquiescence. So
they landed, and the die was cast, ducks changed, and the
goose-pair braving it in dry clothes by the kitchen fire.
There was nothing else to be done; for the answer confessed
to a dislike of immersions two at a time, and the hair clammy
with salt like cottage-bacon on a breakfast-table.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord <span class="smcap">Ormont</span> sat with the jewels
seized from the debating, unbeaten sister's grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">"She is at Marlow," he opined.</p>

<p class="indent">"Was," put in Lady <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">The answer blew him for memory.</p>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Morsfield</span>'s dead," his lordship ventured; "jobbed by a foil
with button off."</p>

<p class="indent">"And a good job too."</p>

<p class="indent">Lady <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> was ever on the crest-wave of the moment's
humour. He snicked a back-stroke to the limits, shaking the sparse
hair of repentance to the wind of her jest. But the unabashed one
continued.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll not call on her."</p>

<p class="indent">"You shall," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shan't," was her lightning-parry.</p>

<p class="indent">"You shall," he persisted.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never. Her head is a water-flower that speaks at ease in the
open sea. How call on a woman with a head like that?"</p>

<p class="indent">The shock struck him fair and square.</p>

<p class="indent">"We wait," he said, and the conflict closed with advantage to the
petticoat.</p>

<p class="indent">A footman bore a letter. His step was of the footman order, calves
stuffed to a longed-for bulbousness, food for donkeys if any such
should chance: he presented it.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wait," he murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">"Whence and whither comes it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Postmark may tell."</p>

<p class="indent">"Best open it," said the cavalry general, ever on the dash for open
country where squadrons may deploy right shoulders up, serre-files
in rear, and a hideous clatter of serjeant-majors spread over all. He
opened it. It was <span class="smcap">Aminta</span>'s letter. She announced a French leave-taking.
The footman still stood. Lord <span class="smcap">Ormont</span> broke the silence.</p>

<p class="indent">"Go and be&mdash;&mdash;" the words quivered into completion, supply the
blank who will.</p>

<p class="indent">But her punishment was certain. For it must be thus. Never a
lady left her wedded husband, but she must needs find herself
weighted with charge of his grand-nephew. Cuckoo-tutor sits in
General's nest, General's wife to bear him company, and lo! the
General brings a grand-nephew to the supplanter, convinced of
nobility beyond petty conventions of divorce-court rigmarole. So the
world wags wilful to the offshoot, lawn-mowers grating, grass flying,
and perspiring gardener slow in his shirt-sleeves primed with hope of
beer that shall line his lean ribs at supper-time, nine o'clock is it, or
eight&mdash;parishes vary, and a wife at home has rules. A year later he
wrote&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Another novel is on hand. Likely you will purchase.
Readers gape for it. Better than acrostics, they say, fit for fifty
puzzle-pages. What price?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh East is East, and West is West," says strenuous <span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling,</span></span>
<span class="i0">And what has the West taught to the East, save the science of war, and tippling?</span>
<span class="i0">To ram, and to torpedo, and to drain Drink's poisoned flagons?</span>
<span class="i0">And Civilisation sees her work in&mdash;armour-plated Dragons!</span>
<span class="i0">The saurians of primeval slime they fought with tooth and claw,</span>
<span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Sho-ki's</span> dragon, though possessed of wondrous powers of jaw,</span>
<span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Miochin's</span> scaly monster, whereat <span class="smcap">Sho-ki's</span> pluck might melt,</span>
<span class="i0">And the dragon speared by stout St. George in the bold cartoons of <span class="smcap">Skelt</span>,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">These were but simple monsters, like the giants slain by <span class="smcap">Jack</span>,</span>
<span class="i0">But your dragon cased in armour-plate with turrets on his back,</span>
<span class="i0">And a charged torpedo twisted in his huge and horrid tail.</span>
<span class="i0">Is a thing to stagger Science, and to make poor Peace turn pale!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, East is East, and West is West; but the West looks on the East,</span>
<span class="i0">And sees the bold Jap summoning to War's wild raven-feast</span>
<span class="i0">The saffron-faced Celestial; and the game they're going to play</span>
<span class="i0">(With a touch of Eastern goriness) in the wicked Western way.</span>
<span class="i0">For the yellow-man has borrowed from the white-man all that's bad,</span>
<span class="i0">From shoddy and fire-water, to the costly Ironclad.</span>
<span class="i0">He will not have our Bibles, but he welcomes our Big Guns,</span>
<span class="i0">And he blends with the wild savagery of Vandals, Goths or Huns,</span>
<span class="i0">The scientific slaughter of the Blood-and-Iron Teuton!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A sight that Civilisation would right willingly be mute on.</span>
<span class="i0">But these armour-plated dragons that infest the Yellow Sea</span>
<span class="i0">Are worse than the Norse "Dragons" whose black raven flag flew free</span>
<span class="i0">O'er fiord and ocean-furrow in the valorous Viking days.</span>
<span class="i0">Heathen Chinee and Pagan Jap have learned our Western ways</span>
<span class="i0">Of multitudinous bloodshed; every slaughtering appliance,</span>
<span class="i0">Devices of death-dealing skill, and deviltries of Science</span>
<span class="i0">Strengthen the stealthy Mongol and the sanguinary Turk;</span>
<span class="i0">And Civilisation stands, and stares, and cries,</span>

meaning to titles&mdash;and yet nothing but rank could confer such perfect
ease and distinction. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I should have said <i>Lady</i>
<span class="smcap">Maisie Mull</span>, undoubtedly&mdash;forgive my ignorance. But at least
I have divined you. Does nothing tell you who and what <i>I</i> may be?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> Oh, I think I can give a tolerable guess at what
<i>you</i> are.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> You recognise the stamp of the Muse upon me, then?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> Well, I shouldn't have taken you for a

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>with some chagrin</i>). You are really too flattering!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> Am I? Then it's your turn now. You might say you'd
never have taken me for a <i>lady's maid</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I might&mdash;if I had any desire to make an unnecessary and
insulting remark.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> Insulting? Why, it's what I <i>am</i>! I'm maid to Lady
<span class="smcap">Maisie</span>. I thought your mysterious instinct told you
all about it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself&mdash;after the first shock</i>). A lady's maid!
Gracious Heaven! What have I been saying&mdash;or rather, what <i>haven't</i>
I? (<i>Aloud.</i>) To&mdash;to be sure it did. Of course, I quite understand
<i>that</i>. (<i>To himself</i>). Oh, confound it all, I wish we were
at Wyvern!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> And, after all, you've never told me who <i>you</i> are.
Who <i>are</i> you?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I must not humiliate this poor girl!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I? Oh&mdash;a very insignificant person, I assure you!
(<i>To himself.</i>) This is an occasion in which deception is
pardonable&mdash;even justifiable!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> Oh, I knew <i>that</i>. But you let out just now you had
to do with a Mews. You aren't a rough-rider, are you?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> N&mdash;not <i>exactly</i>&mdash;not a <i>rough</i>-rider.
(<i>To himself.</i>) Never on a horse in my life!&mdash;unless
I count my <i>Pegasus</i>. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But you are right in
supposing I am connected with a muse&mdash;in one sense.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> I <i>said</i> so, didn't I? Don't you think it was rather
clever of me to spot you, when you're not a bit horsey-looking?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>with elaborate irony</i>). Accept my compliments on a
power of penetration which is simply phenomenal!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> (<i>giving him a little push</i>). Oh, go along&mdash;it's
all talk with you&mdash;I don't believe you mean a word you say!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She's becoming absolutely vulgar.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I don't&mdash;I <i>don't</i>; it's a manner I have; you
mustn't attach any importance to it&mdash;none whatever!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Phill.</i> What! Not to all those high-flown compliments?
Do you mean to tell me you're only a gay deceiver, then?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>in horror</i>). Not a <i>deceiver</i>, no; and
decidedly not <i>gay</i>. I mean I <i>did</i> mean the
<i>compliments</i>, of course. (<i>To himself.</i>) I
mustn't let her suspect anything, or she'll
get talking about it; it would be too horrible
if this were to get round to Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> or
the <span class="smcap">Culverins</span>&mdash;so undignified; and it would

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="indent">"There are, methinks," quoth the Baron, "two or three novels&mdash;one
certainly I can call to mind&mdash;wherein the interior domestic life
of Jews strict in the observance of their ancient and most touching
religious rites and ceremonies is more amply, as well as more
minutely, described than in Mr. <span class="smcap">Farjeon's</span> <i>Aaron the Jew</i>,
which, be it my pleasing duty to testify, is one of the best of this
prolific author's works; a simple, touching story, the interest being
well kept up, as of course the "interest" should be when dealing with
the true history of one who commenced as a pawnbroker." As to the rites
above mentioned, no special or intimate personal experience is shown to
be possessed by the author, who could very easily have obtained his
materials from an interesting work entitled, as I fancy, <i>The Jew at
Home</i>, which has, the Baron regrets to say, disappeared from its shelf
in the Baron's library. <i>Aaron</i> is lively, is gay, is witty, a "<i>Jew
d'esprit,</i>" and, like <i>Mr. Peter Magnus</i>, he amuses a small circle of
intimate friends; but his story, and that of his sweet wife <i>Rachel</i>, as
related by Mr. <span class="smcap">Farjeon</span>, will increase this friendly circle to a very
considerable extent. The Baron ventures to think that a good deal
of the dialogue and of the descriptive writing is unnecessary,&mdash;but
Mr. <span class="smcap">Farjeon</span> likes to give everyone plenty for their money,&mdash;and,
further, that the story would have gained by the loss of what would
have reduced the three volumes to two. But altogether, the novel
is "recommended" by the interested but disinterested</p>

<h3>A LITTLE HOLIDAY.</h3>

<p class="indent"><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;How exhausting is London life! Up late, night and
morning. Club. See summer number of illustrated paper. Pictures
of pretty girls, reclining in punts, hammocks, or deck-chairs, doing
nothing, men helping them. True holiday for jaded Londoner.
Perhaps better without pretty girls. Even more reposeful. Must
get right away. Secluded place. No pretty girls. That tiny inn
<span class="smcap">Jones</span> told me about. Miles from everywhere.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;At Tiny Inn. Fine afternoon. Feel quite happy.
With summer clothes, summer numbers, flannels, straw hat, and
other suitable things. Seven miles from station. Beautifully clean.
Perfectly quiet. Weather changing. Raining. Landlord says,
"Soon over." Eggs and bacon for supper. To bed early.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Wake at five. Up at six to enjoy morning air. Eggs and
bacon for breakfast. Still raining. Landlord says, "Very remarkable,
since in this place it never rains." Somehow the clouds always
pass over neighbouring village, following the course of the river,
the ridge of the hills, or something. Have noticed in all country
places that the clouds always do this, except when <i>I</i> am there.
Impossible to lounge under a tree in this rain. Stop indoors, smoke,
and read summer numbers. Eggs and bacon for lunch. Rain
going on steadily. Put on flannels, go out. Drenched. Eggs and
bacon for dinner. Landlord says they hope to give me some meat to-morrow.
Butcher calls once a week apparently. Wet evening.
Somewhat tired of sitting on horsehair sofa with damaged springs.
Know all the summer numbers by heart. To bed at ten.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Wake at four. Toss about till six. Then up.
Still raining. Breakfast,&mdash;eggs and bacon. Landlord says if I cross
two fields I shall find the river and a punt. Thanks. Will wait till
rain stops. He says it is sure to stop soon. Ask him if one can get
a London paper. Says they sometimes have one at the stationer's,
four miles off, but generally only when ordered. Lends me a local
paper of last week. Reduced to summer numbers again. Begin to
wish there were some pretty girls here, after all. They might enliven
things. After lunch,&mdash;of eggs and bacon,&mdash;resolve to go out. Ask
landlord where one can go. Don't like to ask "if any girls about
anywhere?" Accidentally landlord <i>does</i> happen to mention Farmer
<span class="smcap">Muggeridge's</span> daughters. I pretend indifference, but inquire as to
direction of <span class="smcap">Muggeridge's</span> farm. Lose my way. Wander helplessly.
Steady downpour. Return, drenched. Butcher has not been. Eggs
and bacon for dinner. Smoke, and read advertisements&mdash;plenty of
them&mdash;in summer numbers. To bed at nine.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Wake at three. Toss about till seven. Then breakfast&mdash;usual
dish. Rain, not quite so heavy. With fuller directions
as to road, start hopefully for <span class="smcap">Muggeridge's</span> farm. Arrive there.
Heavy rain again. <span class="smcap">Muggeridge</span> loafing about. Country people
always loaf about in rain. They seem to enjoy it. Chat with him.
He asks me in to have some cider. Accept. Chance of seeing
charming daughters. They enter! Now!... Oh! awful!...
Cider acid. Obliged to drink it. Hurry back. Lunch. Usual dish.
Still raining. Call in landlord, and ask eagerly about trains to
London. The next is to-morrow morning, at 8.20. Give way to
despair. Refuse eggs and bacon for dinner. Bed eight.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Leave in landlord's cart at seven, after usual breakfast.
Still raining steadily. Gave landlord all those summer numbers to
amuse future weather-bound visitors with imaginary pictures of
rural happiness. London once more! Hurrah! Dinner&mdash;<i>not</i> eggs
and bacon. Theatre. Smoke at club. Avoid <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Tell <span class="smcap">Smith</span>
I know the sweetest place for country peace and seclusion. He
writes down the address eagerly. Those summer numbers will amuse
him. To bed&mdash;any time!</p>

<h3>SATURDAY POPS.</h3>
<h4>NEW SERIES.</h4>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Rusticus</span>," who is clearly
"<span class="smcap">Rusticus Expectans</span>," wasmoved to write to the <i>Chronicle</i>
on July 31st, to say that,though not a rich man, he
lives in a pretty Surrey village within an eightpenny return
railway fare of the City; and has a fairly large and quiet
garden, with field, &amp;c. "The trees are all at their finest,"
he proceeds, "the flowers looking very gay and walking in
the garden." Capital fun this, when flowers actually walk
about. But no! it's "walking in the garden to-day the
thought came to me," so it's a walking thought, comparable,
doubtless, to a running commentary. Anyhow. "<span class="smcap">Rusticus</span>"
is moved&mdash;by the thought of a "tired working-man or
band of City workers" who would find in his garden pleasure
on a quiet Saturday afternoon&mdash;to make an offer. Here
are his words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">"I am a bachelor, therefore I say, men, you are welcome to my
very simple hospitality if it is of any use to you. I can do with a
limited number every or any Saturday. Any creed or class is
welcome. All I stipulate for is honest souls. Come and smoke
and talk under the trees and spend a quiet time away from the town.
I simply condition&mdash;no publicity or fuss, the giving and acceptance
of the invitation quietly, honestly, brother to brother. Would you,
Sir, forward any letters on to me?"</p>

<p class="indent">This is of course an example which will be followed, and
<i>Mr. Punch</i> has already had the following letter (amongst
others), which he now prints with pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Owing to the Death
Duties, I am no longer a rich man, but I have a little house
in Piccadilly, not more than a twopenny 'bus ride from
Charing Cross. It has occurred to me that some hungry working-man
might like to drop in to a quiet little dinner some
night. I am a Duke, therefore I say, comrades in depression,
you are welcome to my roof, if it's of any use to you.
I can dine a hundred or so of you any or every night. All I
stipulate for is that there shall be no speaking, for speaking
bores me horribly.</p>

<h3>"AFTER THE HEALTH CONGRESS IS OVER."</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Ball Room at the Mansion House.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>He. (resting).</i> Good floor, isn't it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> Quite. But tell me, have you been attending the Congress?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> Of course; that is why I received an invitation to-night.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> And you found the lectures and all that most interesting?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> Yes, very; and then there were the Opera and the theatres in
the evening.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> But do let us talk about the Congress. Did you not discuss
sanitation?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> Discussed it very much indeed. So fortunate too that we
had the meeting before everybody had left town.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> Yes. But did you not inquire into microbes and all that?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> Certainly; had a lot of talk about them, and finished them
all up just in time not to interfere with Goodwood.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> And I suppose you found out the way to keep everyone in
perfect health?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> That was the idea, and yet we floored Lords and the Oval.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> But oughtn't every town to be in a satisfactory condition?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> Why, yes. But that depends upon the season of the year. Of
course, some places are deadly dull when nothing's going on from a
social point of view.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> I mean from a health point of view&mdash;oughtn't everything
nowadays to be simply excellent?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> Yes, of course. That's the modern theory.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> And yet, according to the papers, London is full of fever
and insanity.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> I daresay; the Press men generally get their figures right.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> But if, theoretically, everything is right, why should most
things be practically wrong?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>He.</i> You must really ask me another.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> But you are strong upon health, are you not?</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p class="indent"><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 30.</i>&mdash;Having settled Budget
Bill, and, incidentally, brought <span class="smcap">Chancellor of Exchequer</span> to
Death's Door by observations on Death Duties, <span class="smcap">Tommy Bowles</span> has
time to turn his attention to another social question. Looks as if he
were going to take the Bicycle Fiend by the scruff of the neck.
Herein he has opportunity of deepening and enlarging his hold on
affection and esteem of British public. Bicycle Fiend has increased,
is increasing, and, at least, ought to be registered. He comes upon
the hapless rider or pedestrian in quiet country lanes, brushing him
aside as if the earth were the Fiend's and all the highways thereof.
Bad enough in the country, where there is room to get out of the
way. In crowded streets of metropolis, Fiend pounces round unsuspected
corners upon elderly gentlemen, scattering streams of peaceful
passengers at peremptory sound of fearsome bell.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Tommy B</span>. got his eye on him. Not without suspicion that this
new departure has something to do with old, now closed, campaign
against the Budget. <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> warned the <span class="smcap">Squire</span> whilst in
Committee that his Death Duties would not reap the full harvest
anticipated. Every little helps. What with actual concussions and
sudden frights, Bicycle Fiend leads in course of financial year to
considerable succession of property changing on sudden death, with
concurrent toll paid to Treasury. If the Bicycle Fiend can only be
placed on same footing as the common carrier, or the harried
hansom-cab driver, the death-rate would appreciably decrease, and
with it the flow of legacy and succession duties. <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> may or
may not look thus far ahead. No matter, if he only succeeds in
restraining a nuisance that is a disgrace to a civilised community.</p>

<p class="indent">The Member for <span class="smcap">Sark</span> tells me he has a Short Way with the B. F.,
which makes him to considerable extent indifferent to slower action
of <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span>, who has evidently never had his shins barked
by this agency. <span class="smcap">Sark</span> says when he takes his walks abroad he
usually carries a stick or umbrella. When, crossing a road, he hears
the tinkle of the Fiend's bell, insolently and imperatively ordering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
him out of the way on pain of being run over, he, instead of flying
for his life, as is the use of the ordinary citizen, carelessly throws
stick or umbrella lance-wise across hollow of right or left arm, according
as the Fiend approaches from one direction or the other. Thus
armed he leisurely pursues his way. If the Fiend continues on the track,
he will run with face or chest on to the point of the umbrella. As
that would be inconvenient to him, he slows up or goes on another
tack, and when he arrives home writes a letter to the <i>Bicycling
Blister</i>, indignantly denouncing a street passenger who wouldn't get
out of his way.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Vote on Account through Committee.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>,"
said <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, looking across at the Front Opposition Bench whilst
<span class="smcap">Courtney</span> was speaking, "succeeds in hiding all traces of storm behind
a smiling countenance. <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, on the contrary, more ingenuous,
less acute in practice of worldly wiles, enables one to realise, even
at this long distance of time, what <span class="smcap">Balak</span>, the son of <span class="smcap">Zippor</span>, King of
Moab, looked like when he stood in the high places of Baal, and listened
to <span class="smcap">Balaam's</span> remarks on the motion for the time-closure to be
applied to the Children of Israel, who had pitched their tents in
the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho, and declined to
budge at the bidding of <span class="smcap">Balak</span>."</p>

<p class="indent">Appearance of Parliamentary
<span class="smcap">Balaam</span> on scene dramatically
effective. Crowded House worked up to highest pitch of excitement
by swift encounter, in which <span class="smcap">John Morley</span> had followed <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span>, and <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, springing in from behind, had clouted the
<span class="smcap">Chief Secretary</span> on the head. The <span class="smcap">Squire</span> had moved time-closure
on Evicted Tenants Bill in speech the studied tameness and
provoking brevity of which had riled Opposition much more than if he
had belaboured them with Harcourtian phrase. <span class="smcap">Sage of Queen
Anne's Gate</span> said a few words, preparatory to packing up for
holiday; then <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> rose from <span class="smcap">Joseph's</span> side to continue debate.
Members, taking it for granted that he, possibly with some reservations
in favour of Eviction Bill whose second reading he had supported,
was about to say ditto to <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> on question of Closure, began
to move towards door. Arrested by <span class="smcap">Courtney's</span> solemn tone, and his
expression of regret, evidently unfeigned, at deplorable condition in
which the House found itself. "Woe to those through whom
offences come!" cried <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> in voice which, as he said, was of
one crying in the wilderness, and seemed for its perfect effect to lack
only hirsute garb, stave and honeypot. "Through whom did the
offence come? Surely," continued the Prophet, bending shaggy eyebrows
upon the bench where the Busy B's hive, "the offence lies
with those Members who, disregarding the true uses, functions,
duties, and high mission of the House, abuse their powers, intent to
destroy possibility of the right conduct of public business."</p>

<p class="indent">Not Ministers, then, with the <span class="smcap">Squire</span> at their head, responsible for the
deadlock, as <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> had painted the scene, and as <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>
had touched it up with stronger colour. It was the Busy Bees.
They and "a junta of irresponsible landlords enforcing their will
upon those who ought to resist them."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">O Balaam! Balaam!</span> M.P. for Bodmin. Was it for this <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>
led thee into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah? For this did
<span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> build seven altars, and offer up the <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>
on every one of them? Long time since such a scene was
wrought in the House. <span class="smcap">Saunderson</span> pished and pshawed, and
looked anxiously round for <span class="smcap">Logan</span>. <span class="smcap">Bartley</span> blushed; <span class="smcap">Hanbury</span>
was hushed; and a tear trickled down the pale cheek of <span class="smcap">Tommy
Bowles</span>&mdash;Cap'en no longer, disrated and denounced.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Time-Closure resolution carried.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Such larks! Yesterday time-closure came into operation
in connection with Evicted Tenants Bill. Arranged that if
debate on Clause I not finished by eleven o'clock to-night, all
Amendments remaining on paper shall be submitted to vote without
further debate. Obstruction scotched; wriggles helplessly, like eel
in muddy depths of river, smitten by the spear.</p>

<p>"Shan't play," whimper <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span> and <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, mingling
their tears at this fresh evidence of tyranny, this last illustration of
man's inhumanity to man.</p>

<p class="indent">Strike ordered in Unionist lines.
Men throw down the pick; hand in the shovel and the hoe; put on their
coats; hang about corners of Lobby in approved strike fashion. If
<span class="smcap">Hanbury</span> and the Blameless <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>
could only be induced to stick short clay pipe in side of mouth
(bowl downwards), fasten a leather strap outside their trousers just
below the knee, and drink four-half out of pewters at bar in the Lobby,
scene would be complete.</p>

<p class="indent">Strike only partial. Fully one
half the men refuse to go out; stand by the masters, turning deaf
ear to blandishments and threats of pickets outside. Strange thing
is that, working at half strength, output more than doubled. Time-closure,
with all hands at work, proposed to complete Committee
by eleven o'clock next Tuesday night. At ten minutes past six
this afternoon the whole thing through. Not hurried either.
Thoroughly debated, divided on, and Bill, in more than one instance,
amended.</p>

<p class="indent">"Fact is," said the <span class="smcap">Squire</span>,
beaming with chastened delight at turn events taken, "we are over-manned
just as London is over-cabbed. Must see if something
can't be done to reduce numbers by refusing licenses for fresh elections
when vacancies occur."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Evicted
Tenants Bill through Committee. Building Societies Bill far advanced.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Back in the mud again. Strike operative only when
Evicted Tenants Bill under consideration. That standing over now
for Report Stage. Meanwhile take up again Equalisation of Rates
Bill. Men on strike stream in, tired of "playing." Wonderful
their eagerness to get to work again, their keen delight in sound of
their own voices, so strangely intermitted. <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>, <span class="smcap">Kimber</span>,
<span class="smcap">Fisher</span>, <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>, and the
<span class="smcap">Woolwich Infant</span> all here again, with
<span class="smcap">Webster</span> (of St. Pancras) wobbling all over the place, like a hen
that has laid an egg somewhere and can't for the life of her just at
the minute think where she left it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Hardly any. As <span class="smcap">Bartley</span> says,
 "must make up for lost time when yesterday and day before work advanced by leaps and bounds."</p>
